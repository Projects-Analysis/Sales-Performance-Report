## Problem Statements 
Given the transactional Fact dataset (Orders) for a Super Store in the US with 2 dimension tables (Returns
and Users), create a dashboard to narrate how well or how bad this superstore is doing across all possible
measures.

##### Steps:
1. Import the dataset into Power BI.
2. Prepare/Transform the data in Power Query Editor.
3. Load the dataset.
4. Model the data (build relationships between your Fact and dimensions)
5. Create Interactive visuals.

## Inspiration to guide your Dashboard:
What questions can be answered looking at this data?
* How much profit is gained for each product category and product container?
* Which Region/city/state has the highest number of customers shopping?
(Hint, create a visual for count of distinct customer by region, city and state; for city and and state, show
Top 5 records)
